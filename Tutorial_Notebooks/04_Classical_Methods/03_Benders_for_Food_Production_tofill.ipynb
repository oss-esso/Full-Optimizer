    "## 1. Understanding Benders Decomposition for Food Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Benders decomposition is a powerful optimization technique that divides complex problems into more manageable components. Your task is to implement this approach for large-scale food production optimization where direct solution methods become computationally prohibitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Structure Analysis\n",
    "Before implementing Benders decomposition, you need to understand how to identify the natural problem structure:\n",
    "- **Master Problem Variables**: High-level strategic decisions that affect the entire system (which farms to activate, investment allocation)\n",
    "- **Subproblem Variables**: Detailed operational decisions that depend on master problem choices (food allocation within each activated farm)\n",
    "- **Coupling Constraints**: Mathematical relationships that link master and subproblem decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decomposition Strategy for Food Production\n",
    "Your implementation should recognize that farm-level food allocation decisions can be optimized independently once farm activation decisions are fixed. This creates a natural hierarchy:\n",
    "- **Master Level**: Farm activation and capacity investment decisions across the entire agricultural network\n",
    "- **Subproblem Level**: Individual farm optimization for food type selection and production allocation\n",
    "- **Information Exchange**: Benders cuts that communicate subproblem insights back to the master problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Framework Implementation\n",
    "You'll need to implement the mathematical transformation from the original integrated problem to the decomposed structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Integrated Problem**:\n",
    "- Decision variables for both farm activation and food allocation\n",
    "- Constraints linking farm capacity to food production\n",
    "- Multi-objective function balancing economic and sustainability goals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Benders Decomposition**:\n",
    "- **Master Problem**: Optimize farm activation decisions with auxiliary variables representing subproblem costs\n",
    "- **Subproblems**: For each farm activation scenario, optimize food allocation independently\n",
    "- **Cut Generation**: Create linear constraints that approximate the relationship between master decisions and subproblem optimal values\n",
    "\n",
    "This decomposition approach allows you to solve problems with hundreds of farms and dozens of food types that would be intractable using direct optimization methods.\n",
