üõ£Ô∏è Road Composition-Based Truck Speed Adjustments - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

This document summarizes the successful implementation of road composition-based 
truck speed adjustments for the VRP optimizer using OSRM routing data.

PROBLEM SOLVED:
================
Previously, the VRP optimizer used either straight-line distances or a single 
default truck speed adjustment factor. This was unrealistic because:
- Highway routes are better for trucks than city routes
- Different road types have different impacts on truck performance
- Uniform adjustments don't reflect real-world routing complexity

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
====================
Enhanced the OSMDistanceCalculator with road composition analysis:

1. OSRM Route Analysis:
   - Extract detailed route steps from OSRM routing service
   - Classify road types (motorway, trunk, primary, secondary, tertiary, residential, service)
   - Calculate road type composition (distance per road type)

2. Weighted Truck Speed Adjustments:
   - Apply different speed ratios for each road type
   - Calculate weighted average based on actual route composition
   - Use route-specific truck factors instead of default uniform factor

3. Integration with VRP Optimizer:
   - Added use_road_composition parameter to OSMDistanceCalculator
   - Modified matrix calculation to use individual routes when composition needed
   - Applied composition-based adjustments to time matrix

FILES MODIFIED:
===============
1. vrp_optimizer_clean.py:
   - Enhanced OSMDistanceCalculator constructor with use_road_composition parameter
   - Added _get_route_with_road_composition() method
   - Added _extract_road_composition() method  
   - Added _classify_road_type() method
   - Enhanced _apply_truck_speed_adjustments() for composition-based logic
   - Added _calculate_weighted_truck_ratio() method
   - Modified solve() method to pass composition parameter

2. test_road_composition_mwe.py:
   - Created comprehensive test demonstrating composition vs default adjustments
   - Tests multiple truck types (standard, heavy) on different route types
   - Shows real road composition analysis with percentages

TRUCK SPEED PROFILES USED:
==========================
From vrp_scenarios.py DEFAULT_TRUCK_SPEED_RATIOS:

STANDARD TRUCK:
- motorway: 1.00 (same as cars)
- trunk: 1.00 (same as cars) 
- primary: 1.00 (same as cars)
- secondary: 1.00 (same as cars)
- tertiary: 1.00 (same as cars)
- residential: 0.80 (20% slower)
- service: 0.83 (17% slower)
- default: 0.80 (20% slower overall)

HEAVY TRUCK:
- motorway: 0.69 (31% slower)
- trunk: 0.80 (20% slower)
- primary: 0.78 (22% slower) 
- secondary: 1.00 (same as cars)
- tertiary: 1.00 (same as cars)
- residential: 0.50 (50% slower)
- service: 0.50 (50% slower)
- default: 0.65 (35% slower overall)

RESULTS ACHIEVED:
=================
Test routes between Italian cities showed realistic differences:

1. Highway Route (Milan ‚Üí Genoa, 91% motorway):
   - Default heavy truck: +53.8% travel time vs cars
   - Composition heavy truck: +39.3% travel time vs cars
   - Improvement: -9.4% vs default (more realistic)

2. Secondary Roads Route (Milan ‚Üí Venice, 95% secondary):
   - Default heavy truck: +53.8% travel time vs cars  
   - Composition heavy truck: +0.2% travel time vs cars
   - Improvement: -34.8% vs default (much more realistic!)

3. Urban Route (Milan ‚Üí Monza, 75% tertiary + residential):
   - Default heavy truck: +53.8% travel time vs cars
   - Composition heavy truck: +9.8% travel time vs cars
   - Improvement: -28.6% vs default (realistic urban penalty)

KEY BENEFITS:
=============
‚úÖ Route-specific truck adjustments based on actual road composition
‚úÖ More realistic travel time estimates for route planning
‚úÖ Better cost estimation for logistics operations
‚úÖ Accounts for highway vs urban route differences
‚úÖ Uses real OSRM route data with detailed road type classification
‚úÖ Maintains backward compatibility with default adjustments

USAGE:
======
To enable road composition-based truck speed adjustments:

```python
# Create OSM calculator with road composition enabled
calculator = OSMDistanceCalculator(
    locations=locations,
    truck_speed_ratios=DEFAULT_TRUCK_SPEED_RATIOS['standard'],
    use_truck_speeds=True,
    use_road_composition=True  # Enable composition analysis
)

# Or in VRP optimizer, set the flag before solving:
optimizer._use_road_composition = True
solution = optimizer.solve(constraint_level="pickup_delivery")
```

TECHNICAL NOTES:
================
- Road composition requires individual OSRM route calls (slower than bulk matrix)
- Road type classification uses pattern matching on route step names
- Falls back to default adjustment if road composition unavailable
- Caches road composition data to avoid repeated API calls
- Compatible with existing truck speed ratio configuration

This implementation provides significantly more realistic truck routing 
for VRP optimization while maintaining flexibility and performance.
